# Prerequisite stuff for the terraform config [WIP]

## Templates

The templates are used by the prereqs build script as a way to process recurrent data and config files for its need while being able to include user-provided data. They can be found under the `./templates` directory.

## Config Definition tables

This tables are used by the prereqs build script to load as required configs and understand what needs to be done where, and to generate the schema for the user-provided config file. They can be found under the `./tables` directory.
